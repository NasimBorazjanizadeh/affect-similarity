I could not leave as I had to wait for help and the tax report had to be done.|3|4|0.0041|0.00318|0.37856|0.40367|0.00865|0.03529|0.00335|0.00404|0.00749|0.04963|0.05502|0.02824|0.00885|0.00209|0.00383|0.00308|0.00204|0.00473|0.00202|0.00214|0.00957|0.00185|0.00843|0.00226|0.00603|0.01958|0.0022|0.20193|0.00956|0.01171|0.00854|0.98909|0.00857|0.00517|

Some time later, when I thought that it had already run away, I saw it lying on our terrace. I came nearer and saw that it was terribly wounded. I informed the ranger who said that the roe must have been attacked by dogs.

I was on my surf ski. Rather large waves to strong current separated me from my ski and we both began to drift slowly (actually rather quickly) away to sea. The direction I was drifting in was taking me straight over a reef on which rather large sharks were constantly being caught. (I was alone with no one to help me).|2|2|0.0031|0.00258|0.00162|0.00722|0.01711|0.00396|0.0044|0.00228|0.00293|0.00615|0.003|0.00141|0.00119|0.00397|0.00145|0.00104|0.00048|0.00259|0.00146|0.00106|0.00556|0.00097|0.02674|0.00112|0.00086|0.00454|0.002|0.91862|0.01123|0.05073|0.0018|0.17173|0.60152|0.00591|

Then I found myself alone in the struggle for this life because my fiancT did not stay next to me my grief and sorrow took on large proportions. I wanted to commit suicide but instead I threw myself against the cause of the irritation.|4|4|0.00557|0.00576|0.02672|0.05726|0.01093|0.01394|0.00446|0.00337|0.02027|0.29538|0.02411|0.0263|0.04178|0.00522|0.02951|0.00684|0.00772|0.00832|0.01643|0.01736|0.00587|0.00416|0.03528|0.00608|0.05678|0.6297|0.00573|0.0785|0.9241|0.00209|0.00098|0.03473|0.01543|0.00125|

I'd introduced (a lover) but introduced as a friend to some members of my family, and my niece Yavanna who's six was home from school and at Mum's and Dad's and was really silly and at first it was ok, but it went on and on - yukky pooh! You eat your snot, etc. and I felt cross she wouldn't stop. But she had an audience and was in one of those moods. Once I'd accepted it was something everyone does at time I felt better - it was partly having my friend there.|5|2|0.01044|0.01951|0.00624|0.11764|0.06443|0.00582|0.01733|0.00542|0.00424|0.19043|0.05406|0.07777|0.07677|0.00525|0.02467|0.0032|0.00529|0.00866|0.01775|0.01569|0.00519|0.00408|0.08355|0.00584|0.01282|0.05665|0.00684|0.14317|0.01773|0.41266|0.14409|0.00115|0.00347|0.00129|
In my 20s - and was going out to dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday. Her (older - in 30s) cousin, really wanted me to get drunk cos I'd visited their (cousin & wife) place quite a bit, but had always been very careful - brought up to believe in moderation in drink (but not guilt repression etc). I mixed drinking with smoking (which I rarely did) and got drunk and had to leave the table to get sick in the loo, and later went home and was sick again; have never felt so awful in my life. And I didn't want to face or tell my other flatmates, or family.|6|3|0.00223|0.00772|0.01239|0.06641|0.01635|0.01336|0.0033|0.00206|0.00601|0.17619|0.02187|0.04599|0.02388|0.00247|0.03698|0.0025|0.0027|0.0042|0.005|0.01013|0.00423|0.0021|0.03049|0.00299|0.0127|0.15866|0.00257|0.15028|0.98886|0.00284|0.00222|0.00437|0.00604|0.003|

We escaped and slept in the bush for 2 nights.|2|4|0.01242|0.01314|0.01697|0.02564|0.03734|0.02595|0.00931|0.00734|0.00878|0.04689|0.00836|0.0626|0.03725|0.01491|0.57036|0.01499|0.00792|0.00858|0.01744|0.0546|0.01406|0.00558|0.03531|0.0058|0.02221|0.11096|0.02159|0.10211|0.00913|0.00565|0.00296|0.04977|0.94272|0.00648|

Fear is an emotion that I experience very often.  Naturally this is during exams and subsequently while waiting for the results.  However there is one occassion when I was paralyzed with fear.  This was when I was doing my M.A.-I, and we had a series of student lectures.  I was one of the participants and my lecture happened to be the opening lecture.  I had been confident all morning, about twenty minutes before the lecture, my confidence started failing me.  I felt my heart go cold, my lips go dry and I was really paralyzed.

This is an event I will never forget.  I am considered a good mimic.  This particular day we were waiting for a professor to take her class.  This  professor had a peculiar accent and a very horrible way of lecturing and to top it all we had this class at the fag end of the day.  So this particular day I got into my element and started imitating the professor, and the professor entered the class right in the middle of it .  I was unaware of her presence, some of my friends tried to warn me but it was of no avail as I was too engrossed in mimicing.  Then I suddenly noticed the silence and turned around to see her entering the class.  I do not know till today if she actually saw what I had been doing or she had completely ignored it.  Through  out that lecture I died of shame.  All the more shameful was the fact that she gave me a character certificate. |6|4|0.01271|0.00834|0.00667|0.0507|0.02795|0.00351|0.02406|0.00815|0.01033|0.14559|0.01237|0.01991|0.02947|0.01312|0.04774|0.00367|0.00499|0.00453|0.0023|0.01424|0.01177|0.00455|0.17734|0.00354|0.0252|0.04227|0.03765|0.05636|0.93107|0.00285|0.00092|0.02601|0.00717|0.00212|

This happened when it was finally confirmed that I had stood first in the university for the M.A exams.  A few days before the official results were declared a clerk had brought the results unofficially.  So I had been expecting the results but the confirmation allowed me to legitimately feel happy at my success. |1|4|0.02096|0.00896|0.0016|0.00636|0.08116|0.01776|0.00822|0.00451|0.02529|0.02252|0.0063|0.00186|0.00353|0.09755|0.00275|0.01518|0.00361|0.23322|0.00459|0.0041|0.03465|0.00645|0.05493|0.0109|0.00678|0.02599|0.0147|0.17916|0.00298|0.9913|0.00488|0.00306|0.00233|0.00274|
This was when I was being followed home every day from the campus, by a stranger.  He would follow me to the campus and then sit outside my class.  If I was not there he would ask my friends as to where I was.  He was a dark, ominous looking person and I was terrified of him as I did not know his intentions.

I had made an error in planning a programme and had publicly accepted the mistake, despite repeated requests not to bring the matter for discussion a professor kept constantly passing remarks.

A few weeks back I had a very important seminar and I had circulated my papers to all the panel members.  A day before the seminar I realized that I had inadvertantly burdened certain       derivations and I had failed to correct it.  I feared that this    would reflect very badly on my performance.  Fortunately none of  the panel members detected it and I felt relieved.|2|3|0.00792|0.00594|0.00298|0.01116|0.03305|0.0338|0.01789|0.01003|0.08516|0.10983|0.00807|0.00498|0.01403|0.03333|0.01981|0.03451|0.00991|0.02784|0.00357|0.01692|0.12085|0.00823|0.1485|0.01325|0.08577|0.08892|0.05125|0.06599|0.01292|0.95668|0.00197|0.00178|0.00286|0.002|
A few days back a friend of mine poked me in the ribs for fun's sake, though I had warned him an infinite number of times that it really hurts me, he did it again.

Yesterday, I was just about to cross the road when a country guy who was ahead of me spat out a mouthful of betel juice on the road.

This happened when I was in the 10th standard.  The paddy crops were in a bad shape as it had not rained and there was no water in the well, so I was in a very sad mood.

I quarrelled with my brothers (twins) at home on saturday.  One of them studies in a private school and the other one is repeating his form five.  They do not know what they are doing.  They follow every word of their teachers, books and systems.  They always try to rationalize their bad acts by some game and they are satisfied with their awkward life.  I have tried to persuade them very often but have failed.  This time I had a fight as they have no voluntary spirit (they did not polish the floor).|3|3|0.00264|0.00498|0.02007|0.14838|0.03396|0.01328|0.00862|0.00521|0.01797|0.18266|0.04419|0.01097|0.0139|0.00247|0.00525|0.00141|0.00268|0.00364|0.00741|0.00533|0.00558|0.00254|0.0621|0.0033|0.01398|0.07213|0.00278|0.30236|0.05942|0.11366|0.00117|0.45341|0.00292|0.00077|
I have been thinking of changing my major for a few months.  My original major was Chinese language and it blocks my way.  I have to face many problems at the sametime and I do not know what is real and virtuous.  I do not know if I am not interested in Chinese or if there are other factors which make me sad.  I am not very clear on what I can do for the study of Communication and Journalism.  I am not clear about what I can do.  What are the limitations ?   I hesitate but I feel more adjusted now.|4|4|0.00321|0.00407|0.00318|0.02163|0.0467|0.00586|0.1822|0.03989|0.0142|0.09477|0.05499|0.00276|0.00559|0.00514|0.00772|0.00238|0.00284|0.00227|0.00199|0.00579|0.01501|0.0019|0.1113|0.00351|0.01435|0.061|0.01136|0.10244|0.04428|0.95682|0.00328|0.00149|0.00194|0.00188|

I am disgusted by people who spoil their identity because of misbehaviour.

He did not respond and I felt very angry.|5|1|0.00458|0.00743|0.49487|0.33935|0.00361|0.00993|0.00427|0.00489|0.00483|0.05097|0.02786|0.11725|0.0283|0.00239|0.01166|0.00478|0.00311|0.00547|0.00441|0.00358|0.00697|0.00206|0.00926|0.00233|0.0134|0.03016|0.00501|0.02952|0.00717|0.00764|0.00531|0.9873|0.00987|0.00496|

I worked with several classmates on a project.  I was very anxious about the project while my partners showed no concern  and when we had meetings on the project my classmates  did not pay any attention.  Some of them read books while the others argued on irrelevant questions.  The meeting would go on for two hours without the main theme being discussed.  We wasted time and could not reach a compromise.

She still prepared lunch for me and did not scold me .  Suddenly, I thought that it was my fault and I started crying.  |7|2|0.01237|0.00846|0.02273|0.04557|0.01314|0.01839|0.00705|0.00518|0.0118|0.26949|0.02555|0.03044|0.04556|0.00558|0.02989|0.00716|0.00961|0.00664|0.01212|0.01752|0.00808|0.00417|0.02954|0.00724|0.07619|0.73655|0.00535|0.05956|0.97506|0.00336|0.0012|0.02291|0.00706|0.00207|

I was very eager to replace her in suffernig , even die instead of her.|4|4|0.00763|0.00254|0.01132|0.03153|0.01522|0.09073|0.00199|0.00303|0.04624|0.17131|0.01608|0.00635|0.00919|0.00999|0.01446|0.00616|0.00385|0.02537|0.01093|0.01084|0.02493|0.00483|0.02077|0.0072|0.00813|0.21184|0.00394|0.24352|0.06056|0.39957|0.00144|0.00898|0.00995|0.00079|

One Saturday afternoon, I deliberately dressed up nicely (I had been in a bad mood of late).  I hoped to go for a walk in the soft sunlight to try and uplift my spirits.  When I was having lunch in the canteen, two of my male classmates asked me as to why I was dressed so nicely (they had seldom joked with me before).  One of them said that he had a lounge suit and we would look very nice if we wore them together.|1|3|0.02774|0.0026|0.00156|0.0051|0.04601|0.04238|0.00479|0.0071|0.09456|0.00945|0.00275|0.00128|0.00153|0.01242|0.00295|0.01045|0.00147|0.0113|0.00629|0.00183|0.4753|0.0024|0.03028|0.00373|0.00242|0.00352|0.00368|0.09991|0.0022|0.64357|0.00773|0.1997|0.0141|0.00424|

Our class had organized a picnic in November.  I was the class representative so I became the organizor.  However the picnic was postponed by one week and I had something else to do then. Initially I did not ponder on what to do and decided to go for the picnic.  When I had the time to think about it I thought that my decision was wrong.  My classmates thought that I would go as I had signed my name but I did not go.  I told another class representative that I was not going but he did not know the reason behind my not going.  After the picnic my classmates asked me why I had not gone to the picnic and everytime someone mentioned it I was apologetic.  I should have decided right in the begining that I would not go and then they would not see me as irresponsible i.e promising to go and changing my mind afterwards.|7|3|0.00093|0.00381|0.00358|0.02586|0.07611|0.00717|0.05258|0.0124|0.03016|0.05106|0.03686|0.00316|0.00462|0.00275|0.00436|0.00207|0.00159|0.00153|0.00188|0.00321|0.02525|0.00146|0.14727|0.00254|0.0098|0.0106|0.00391|0.49856|0.12876|0.01687|0.00138|0.84814|0.00543|0.00192|

I was a prefect at secondary school.  On the sports day I told others that I would take down the names of the people who misbehaved and after some time I sat down for a brief rest.  Suddenly the head prefect came and scolded me in front of others.  I was very angry as there were other prefects sitting and he picked on me.  I thought that a brief rest was not  serious enough to be blamed.|3|3|0.00251|0.00873|0.41659|0.32815|0.00393|0.01047|0.00514|0.00515|0.00556|0.05731|0.04148|0.0492|0.02181|0.00184|0.00511|0.00425|0.00258|0.00388|0.00202|0.00257|0.00637|0.00166|0.01145|0.00223|0.02265|0.03399|0.00354|0.05723|0.02153|0.00772|0.00287|0.97521|0.01431|0.00352|

I had joined a youth group that observed the affairs of our community and so I had many opportunities to contact the government and the committee members of the district board (a local executive structure).  We always tried to consult and discuss with them, but we found that such people did not understand community affairs and they even dampened our enthusiasm in local affairs.  I did not understand why they had decided to work as community leaders.|5|2|0.01068|0.00441|0.00314|0.02916|0.20472|0.005|0.15692|0.03792|0.03501|0.06082|0.03987|0.00271|0.00459|0.01457|0.00497|0.00235|0.00335|0.00372|0.00418|0.00501|0.02995|0.0035|0.2859|0.00428|0.00721|0.00743|0.03539|0.17725|0.00206|0.95717|0.00451|0.03763|0.00677|0.00407|
One day I was the leader of the weekly meeting of the Church fellowship.  That day I had been preparing for the exams and did not estimate the time to travel to the church right and I was twenty minutes late.  As I had not prepared well I led the meeting badly.  I was ashamed of myself.  |6|2|0.00585|0.0134|0.03028|0.06705|0.01119|0.0078|0.0141|0.00997|0.00641|0.18783|0.03029|0.07332|0.13478|0.0056|0.02972|0.00734|0.00965|0.0059|0.0077|0.01644|0.00434|0.00354|0.0469|0.00566|0.19884|0.29378|0.01599|0.03706|0.74669|0.00903|0.00087|0.1|0.00775|0.00096|
I borrowed my classmate's notebook one week before the examination and I promised to give it back to her in two days time.  I was very busy at that time and forgot many things; as I was not very often at home she could not contact me.  When I started my revision I realized that her notebook had been on my desk for five days.  I contacted her immediately and gave it back to her.  Though she did not say anything I felt very guilty.|7|2|0.00146|0.00703|0.00738|0.02153|0.03259|0.01115|0.02064|0.01182|0.04178|0.08452|0.01342|0.00611|0.01948|0.00514|0.01196|0.00762|0.00611|0.00394|0.00535|0.00988|0.011|0.00283|0.11747|0.00464|0.21264|0.14536|0.01272|0.18284|0.989|0.00422|0.00216|0.00355|0.00441|0.00228|

When I got into a bus I found that my wallet had been stolen. It was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but I lost some documents - identity papers.  As a result I had to spend several days in order to get a new one.  I will always remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil servant.  I had already had bad luck and they treated me like a criminal.   At one point of time I really wanted to quarrel with them.|3|3|0.00827|0.00403|0.00608|0.02754|0.03241|0.02823|0.00849|0.00454|0.13771|0.2942|0.01358|0.00558|0.01213|0.00953|0.01525|0.0058|0.00609|0.01091|0.00791|0.01268|0.05135|0.00645|0.12179|0.00755|0.01955|0.17172|0.00705|0.16896|0.29554|0.00353|0.00132|0.68367|0.00411|0.00115|

During these Summer vacations a schoolmate who was not in my class went to Britain.  Before he left, his classmates and some of us who were accquainted with him had a B.B.Q on the beach.  When I arrived I saw that some people , who were not close friends of the departing person(person A), were playing mahjong.  Some others were playing bridge and A had nothing to do, besides it was A who had prepared the food.  Later when we wanted to talk and his classmates did not even have the decency to listen to him.  They only asked him a few questions half-heartedly and then they talked on their own.  Some of their conversation was against me and  another classmate.|5|3|0.00235|0.00214|0.00235|0.01087|0.01173|0.00193|0.00692|0.00379|0.00144|0.00561|0.0087|0.00161|0.00103|0.0022|0.00073|0.00047|0.00033|0.00126|0.00131|0.00062|0.00313|0.00065|0.01851|0.00076|0.00051|0.00231|0.00172|0.94451|0.01252|0.03058|0.00245|0.73698|0.07173|0.00196|

I realized that I had seen her purse on the floor and had not wanted to do any thing about it. |6|2|0.00597|0.00816|0.00383|0.01949|0.04333|0.01678|0.02989|0.01495|0.0381|0.12071|0.00756|0.01093|0.02286|0.03492|0.0813|0.00847|0.00737|0.01454|0.00818|0.04364|0.02445|0.00779|0.24361|0.00994|0.02506|0.06038|0.04712|0.24789|0.01502|0.01028|0.00369|0.01008|0.97883|0.01335|

A few days back I was waiting for the bus at the bus stop.  Before getting into the bus I had prepared the exact amount of coins to pay for the bus fair and when I got into the bus I put these coins into the box meant to collect the bus fair.  I thought that I had paid and wanted to get inside.  However the bus driver called me and asked me in an impolite way if the coins were stuck at the opening  of the box.  He had not seen me paying and there wasn't a stack of coins in the box.  I could not understand this and the driver kept questioning me.  He made me feel angry and at last i inserted a dollar coin in the box just to get away from him.  Later I found that I had forgotten a few coins in my pocket and had not paid enough for the fair the first time.  After I had entered the bus I could still hear him scolding me and I felt disgusted.|5|2|0.00189|0.00379|0.1483|0.26587|0.00649|0.00809|0.01204|0.00853|0.0069|0.09869|0.02487|0.04221|0.03021|0.00221|0.01309|0.00224|0.00305|0.00228|0.00223|0.00527|0.00508|0.00202|0.03056|0.00225|0.03062|0.04575|0.00441|0.0858|0.00802|0.00869|0.00686|0.98813|0.00602|0.00562|
A few days back I had a tutorial class and the teacher randomly assigned one person in each group to make a presentation.  The discussion in our group had been confused and the presentation was not very well prepared.  Unfortunately I was selected to present and I could not keep calm, was confused and result was very poor.  I really felt ashamed.|6|4|0.00697|0.02217|0.01349|0.04045|0.01233|0.00741|0.02291|0.01159|0.00733|0.20551|0.03679|0.05465|0.12903|0.00847|0.03324|0.01515|0.01254|0.00945|0.00815|0.02161|0.00567|0.00444|0.05432|0.00841|0.23644|0.4296|0.0255|0.02765|0.98301|0.00274|0.0015|0.00478|0.00763|0.0026|

I had a dream : I had a very close friend who had several stone houses in the New Territories (villages) but they did not have much furniture.  He took me to see his fields (I had never seen them before) and there were several inches of clear water on which the sunshine was reflected.  I wanted to sit among the short green plants in the fields but was afraid of treading the plants to death.  My friend said \They will not die\" and I sat á|1|4|0.00421|0.00426|0.00421|0.0128|0.0484|0.01617|0.0115|0.0062|0.08042|0.07892|0.00742|0.0066|0.00967|0.00824|0.09048|0.00366|0.00343|0.00311|0.01426|0.01789|0.03138|0.00451|0.13858|0.00407|0.01015|0.05243|0.01159|0.34311|0.00481|0.01801|0.00696|0.02321|0.96812|0.00797|

My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.  I felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so he should not have behaved like that.  I was very angry (as it is I was in a bad mood then).|3|4|0.00284|0.01475|0.48214|0.36607|0.00467|0.00943|0.00424|0.00383|0.00508|0.03711|0.03427|0.05146|0.01364|0.00174|0.00419|0.00299|0.00202|0.0046|0.00356|0.00223|0.00736|0.00156|0.00893|0.00186|0.00842|0.02137|0.00242|0.06369|0.00317|0.02997|0.70324|0.20181|0.00329|0.00249|
I suddenly found that those whom I considerered to be my good friends did not care for me.  Although I could still be with them I felt unimportant.  I deeply thought about the reason behind this so as to see who was responsible for this.  Finally I made up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them.  I was sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends.|4|4|0.01418|0.01209|0.00823|0.01584|0.01472|0.01466|0.00786|0.00525|0.01856|0.18832|0.02223|0.00703|0.01683|0.00813|0.01148|0.00929|0.00707|0.01491|0.01916|0.01211|0.01015|0.00425|0.03201|0.00838|0.03582|0.78841|0.00795|0.07861|0.99391|0.00597|0.00306|0.00321|0.00476|0.00407|

During the exam period I studied in the library alone.  A close   friend of mine, who is also a classmate, told me that my application for a Japanese inter-cultural exchange programme had been accepted.  I was not very sure as I did not know that the list had been declared.  I ran to the board and saw that I was really included in the list.  I was so excited that I smiled all day long.  When I met my classmates and friends I told them the good news.  I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my studies. |1|0|0.0448|0.0109|0.00122|0.00358|0.03104|0.00815|0.00673|0.00966|0.00778|0.00514|0.00371|0.00116|0.00172|0.17725|0.00144|0.02447|0.00181|0.44834|0.01533|0.00208|0.01264|0.00399|0.01161|0.0069|0.00141|0.00478|0.01376|0.06555|0.00206|0.97872|0.00449|0.00958|0.00324|0.00268|
A boy phoned me at night and wanted to talk to me for 30 minutes outside.  I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would question me on our relationship.  I treated him as a friend and did not want any misunderstandings.  Therefore I refused to meet him and told him that I would see him the coming day.  I was very unhappy as I feared having hurt him and got him into trouble.|2|2|0.00266|0.00341|0.01098|0.03963|0.01949|0.02819|0.00747|0.00418|0.03551|0.32483|0.03014|0.00902|0.01554|0.004|0.0166|0.00275|0.00395|0.00542|0.00727|0.01234|0.01262|0.00325|0.05307|0.00566|0.02203|0.3074|0.00383|0.2591|0.13718|0.00252|0.00368|0.84015|0.01138|0.00108|

One night during dinner my nephew was naughty, so I quarrelled with my  parents.   I regreted this as my nephew was only two years old and I  had to tolerate him !  The quarrel made my father think that his children  may not take care of him in the future (it was a slip of the tongue and  this made me realize that my father keeps his thoughts to himself).  I was  still very angry so I dropped my bowl and chopsticks and went to the kitchen  to drink tea and then ran to the other side of the house.|7|1|0.00473|0.01102|0.12542|0.09459|0.012|0.02211|0.01221|0.01658|0.01956|0.089|0.02618|0.02707|0.05406|0.00712|0.01246|0.0103|0.01068|0.00717|0.00585|0.00874|0.01028|0.00368|0.0314|0.006|0.46106|0.26197|0.01124|0.04534|0.01174|0.00558|0.00792|0.98304|0.00582|0.003|

At secondary school, one of my classmates lost her locker key.  During a class I saw two other classmates holding a key and talking secretly.  I do not know why I suspected them, also another classmate supported me.  He remembers that these people had only one key in the key-ring, this had seemed strange to him.  Besides another classmate said that he had seen them selling books at a book-shop and they should not have had such books.  I told the teacher and the person was caught.  He had sold the books and was forced to quit school.  I found that I had not helped him as he stole later on also.

My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did not feel angry at him.

However I could not apologize, so I pretended that nothing had happened and smiled when I left.

It was a week before the higher level results were announced.  I had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that I was taking the exam.  I knew that if i failed again I woulld have to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period - I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice experience.  When I thought about the future, an unexplainable fear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my brother had gone to university.  Whenevr I thought of this issue I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased.|2|2|0.00889|0.00786|0.00495|0.0144|0.04795|0.01381|0.03021|0.00944|0.07862|0.13789|0.01129|0.01147|0.01653|0.01601|0.19838|0.00643|0.00696|0.00458|0.01099|0.03199|0.12053|0.00692|0.21998|0.00646|0.01793|0.05181|0.02848|0.12592|0.02406|0.12356|0.00166|0.16998|0.20639|0.0027|

At hostel, my roommate was a very selfish person and would avoid doing anyhting that did not concern him.  A few of us prepared lunch together and had decided to share the work.  My roomate had promised to do the same but I had to wash the bowls everytime after dinner.  I tried to wait and thought that he would realize his fault.  I did not want to tell him to do the work as he is a university student and ought to have self-respect.  He disappointed me and so every time I saw him I tried to avoid him and did not want to keep any contact with him.|5|2|0.00417|0.00269|0.02054|0.10845|0.04062|0.02595|0.0104|0.00361|0.02575|0.35095|0.14526|0.012|0.01613|0.00225|0.00869|0.00242|0.0034|0.00286|0.00492|0.00656|0.02076|0.00275|0.07443|0.00422|0.01477|0.0646|0.00352|0.19842|0.52996|0.00468|0.00233|0.6791|0.00183|0.0015|

In the past I used to think that my mother was a very nagging person.  When I started living at the hostel we had little time to meet each other.  Whenever I went home she would take care of me.  I gradually realized that what she had done was for my own good.  So very time I saw her I felt guilty.|7|1|0.00508|0.01578|0.01122|0.02783|0.03414|0.01519|0.02742|0.01479|0.03111|0.17116|0.014|0.0174|0.05949|0.00901|0.04761|0.01122|0.01577|0.00647|0.00925|0.02542|0.01563|0.00498|0.12946|0.00804|0.37792|0.38438|0.0248|0.03994|0.99028|0.00363|0.00233|0.00587|0.00461|0.00249|

On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results were bad because of my lazyness.

This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.  I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock.|4|2|0.00638|0.00759|0.00656|0.02085|0.01955|0.03012|0.02015|0.01295|0.01903|0.2333|0.01124|0.01884|0.02955|0.01711|0.20782|0.0103|0.00895|0.01193|0.01219|0.06664|0.01423|0.0058|0.06727|0.00975|0.02921|0.40387|0.0194|0.09197|0.00926|0.02786|0.00235|0.05296|0.92501|0.00562|
My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had melody but had no content.  We lived together so when he played the recorder I was forced to listen to them.  I could not tell him that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right to disturb the freedom of others.  So I would find a pretext to leave the room and go somewhere else.|5|3|0.00133|0.00186|0.00308|0.02282|0.04072|0.00726|0.01084|0.00591|0.02626|0.02887|0.01693|0.00184|0.00205|0.00199|0.00141|0.00071|0.00077|0.00217|0.00434|0.00154|0.01235|0.00119|0.06263|0.00178|0.0018|0.00788|0.00213|0.7942|0.6166|0.00961|0.00112|0.36671|0.00574|0.00109|
Last Summer I went camping with some C.U students.  As I was working then, I had to leave the second night (some of them had joined us the first night).  Next morning, 6 o'clock, a female classmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up.  I was not fully conscious and I said something which I should not have.  I realized the trouble I had made and wanted to hide.  Later I said sorry to her and the matter came to an end.|6|2|0.00178|0.00962|0.00655|0.01483|0.02255|0.01036|0.02959|0.01263|0.03468|0.06063|0.01069|0.00675|0.02016|0.00739|0.01524|0.00797|0.00683|0.00457|0.00383|0.00969|0.01713|0.00282|0.13469|0.00507|0.34255|0.16088|0.01864|0.10875|0.65932|0.00526|0.00094|0.03395|0.04029|0.00132|

Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.  When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another child to teach.|3|2|0.0018|0.00208|0.00984|0.06922|0.02909|0.00636|0.00654|0.00365|0.00604|0.13248|0.0663|0.00554|0.00561|0.00192|0.00212|0.00068|0.00115|0.00312|0.0041|0.00228|0.00369|0.00131|0.03837|0.00222|0.00443|0.05124|0.00224|0.48707|0.99404|0.00389|0.00359|0.00584|0.00368|0.0035|
